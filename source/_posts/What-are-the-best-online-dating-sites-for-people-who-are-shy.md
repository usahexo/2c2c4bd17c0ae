#  What are the best online dating sites for people who are shy?

Online dating can be a great way for shy people to find a partner. There are many different online dating sites that cater to different audiences, so there is sure to be one that is perfect for shy individuals.

Some of the best online dating sites for shy people are those that focus on compatibility and personality traits rather than looks. These sites allow users to fill out questionnaires about their interests and personality, which helps create matches that are compatible.

Another great feature of some online dating sites for shy people is the ability to limit who can see your profile. This allows users to gradually get to know other members before revealing their identity. This can make shy people feel more comfortable and safe when using online dating sites.

Finally, it is important to find a site that has a large user base. This will ensure that there are plenty of potential matches for shy people.

#  What are the best online dating sites for people who are looking for a serious relationship?

This is a question that a lot of people seem to have an opinion on, and there are countless websites, articles, and blog posts that purport to have the answer. But the truth is, there’s no single best online dating site for everyone – it depends on what you’re looking for.

For example, if you’re looking for something casual and short-term, then apps like Tinder or Bumble might be a better option than OkCupid or Match.com. If you’re looking for something more serious, though, those sites might be better choices.

Another thing to think about is how important features like matching are to you. Some sites have extremely detailed algorithms that try to match you with someone who shares all of your interests, while others are more simplistic and just ask you to fill out a basic profile.

The bottom line is that there isn’t one “right” answer when it comes to finding the best online dating site for you – it all depends on what you’re looking for in a relationship and what kind of site will make you feel most comfortable. Do your research, take some time to explore different options, and don’t be afraid to switch if something doesn’t feel right.
